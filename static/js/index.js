However, the large model size hinders their deployment to mobile devices. Therefore, I decided to examine the compression of neural networks without causing a significant loss of accuracy for my master thesis. In addition, I consider image compression as a way of reducing the computational complexity and combine both compression types.</p>\n" +
            "                    <p>Hyperspectral images have more spectral fidelity and precision for the profiling of organisms than RGB images, which is why I chose them for the project. Nevertheless, these properties lead to a high number of dimensions, which must be reduced, e.g., with dimensionality reduction techniques. On the one hand, one can decide to reduce the number of usually hundreds of image channels according to their relevance using feature extraction oder remove irrelevant ones (feature selection). On the other hand, I investigate the usefulness of model compression by removing connections between neurons, which contribute the least to the end result (parameter pruning), and use a code book to represent the weights of these connections with fewer bits (e.g., post-training vector quantization). The purpose of this procedure is to investigate the effects of compression on multiple levels by analyzing the tradeoffs regarding parameters like memory usage, computational expense and precision and visualize the layers of the neural network to understand which parts of the image are most relevant for the activation of decisive neurons.</p>\n" +

            "                    <p>It has emerged that moderate parameter pruning (depending on the model, up to 40 percent) not only does not decrease a classification accuracy, but even improves it compared to the reference, while model size, VRAM and RAM usage decline. Only at percentages higher than 40 to 50 percent does the accuracy deteriorate, which is exacerbated more and more towards the end (80 to 90 percent pruning). The number of parameters in linear layers can be reduced more than for convolutional layers without loss of accuracy. In particular, large CNN models offer considerable potential for model size reduction. Feature extraction techniques like PCA, NMF and LLE need only few image bands as components to quickly achieve a high accuracy, while feature selection acts way less predictably. A component-wise variation with post-training quantization reveals accumulators to be the most important components, followed by activations and weights of the CNN respectively, but without accuracy gain. The stated compressions can be accumulated, which leads to comparably high accuracies without as much complexity. Visualizations show that it is only at high compression rates that meaningful gradients of the CNN change significantly and with them, the accuracy. Despite the satisfying results, the currently poor tool support, especially for the hyperspectral case, is probably the most important obstacle to the usage of pruning and quantization on an industrial scale.</p>\n" +

More precisely, I am applying parameter pruning and an optional vector quantization on top. In doing so, I observe how relevant parameters like memory usage and inference time have changed as well.

            "                    <p>To go into detail, the first step is the flashcard generation, which allows the inputs PDF / Document, Audio / Voice (using Speech to Text) and free-form input. Therefore, the tool would ideally be able to generate flashcards from lecture notes, lecture slides and large PDF lecture summaries, which students are often given.</p>\n" +
            "                    <p>Once all the cards are created, a learning session can be started. It is possible to periodically schedule such a session based on the time remaining until the exam and the desired interval frequency. In the latter case, the student gets Outlook reminders to try the questions once again when it is time to do so. The candidate sees the categories into which the flashcard questions are grouped, including specific keywords and questions the candidate got wrong/right in the past. After selecting a question, the candidate can submit an answer using free text, voice or video. Azure's AI assesses the correctness of the answer using the keywords it extracts from it. Additional information for the question and answer can be displayed using Azure Bing Search.</p>\n" +
            "                    <p>To realize a community-based approach, the user is matched up with other community members based on his score, the lecture/topic and the flash card success rate. Using this approach, not only is personalized learning made possible, but students can exchange ideas so that a talented person in one area can learn from an expert in another.</p>\n" +
            "                    <p>Technically speaking, Azure Functions was a good choice for serverless code because my team could build functions which could easily be included in the Power App. Altogether, the bare-bones app we have built in the limited timeframe of just 24 hours allowed us to outline both our technical and business concept to an audience and set the stage for further development.</p>\n" +

            "<p>Molehill Empire is a game that is based on planting, watering and harvesting fruit and vegetables in different gardens that are available to the player. To do this, he is supposed to click on each field of the 17*12-sized garden (in the standard case), although variants like the water garden exist, along with several other features of the game like guilds, contests, cactus gardens etc., which shall not be relevant for now. Obviously, this becomes tedious very fast. In addition, level progression in the game is really slow, although a premium currency called coins exists. One coin can be sold on the in-game market place for tens of thousands of in-game currency (e.g., 40,000wT). To get coins, one can choose to watch ads. However, this system of watching ads, as I have found out, is broken from the technical point of view, which opens up the perspective of implementing a proof-of-concept for generating a potentially infinite number of coins for a player, if one excludes the dangers of human intervention and account banning.</p>\n" +
            "<p>To address the need for repeated clicking, I used macros with the KraTronic recorder and ReMouse to help out, where the latter option is faster. These can be recorded or generated by my Java tool. It simplifies planting and watering the vegetables and provides a good basis for scheduling macros through cron or Windows' task scheduler. Scheduling macros on remote machines or NASes can be especially useful for events, where you are supposed to harvest and plant vegetables every 6 hours or so. This automation made the game more fun to play.</p>\n" +
            "<p>To top it all off, viewing ads allows for faster game progression, but instead of watching them on VMs, where the viewing experience is automated with macros, one can replay requests (e.g., with Fiddler) for the same effect. In essence, you need to generate a token and use it as a parameter for the ad callback, as my YouTube video shows. To make things more handy, I wrote a Java program to automate the replay of the requests, so one does not need to manually replay requests in Fiddler. This Java tool also can view ads from the drive-in cinema (an in-game event), redeem coins and complete the infinite quest series. These are quests one can fulfill only in a certain location you can drive to on Wednesdays and Saturdays in the game, but thanks to sloppy programming, I can attempt them without this location restriction every 24 hours.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Please be warned that the IntelliJ projects do not necessarily reflect any effort for clean code whatsoever, as the goal was not to create maintainable software for a client, but to get a program up and running just for me as fast as possible. As a result of my automations, a player can get ahead fast in this otherwise remarkably slow-paced game (who knows when its servers will be terminated anyway) and the game was actually fun to play because of that.</p>\n" +

This extension features a deep learning model running on your computer that can confirm or refute your gut feeling about a text being (severely) toxic, a threat, sexually explicit, obscene, an insult or an identity attack. That way, you can check if it is just your opinion or if the text is actually hateful. Apart from that, the purpose of this app is to experiment with Tensorflow.js so that every user can see what an in-built deep learning model based on a Universal Sentence Encoder is capable of doing without needing to understand anything about AI. The classification works for English only and considers the seven categories mentioned above.</p>\n" +
            "<p>How it works: Right-click on any text selection and choose \"Analyze for hate\". This will trigger the inference of the model, which is the text toxicity detection example available for TensorFlow.js. After the inference finishes (might take up to a few seconds), the text is highlighted with a color, depending on whether the hate type or the lack thereof has been detected or the result has been inconclusive. Hover over the marked text to find out which of the seven categories have been detected, one of which is used for the purpose of color highlighting. The user can customize which of the seven criteria the model should use for analysis in the popup menu of the addon. Just click on the icon of the extension, choose the desired option from the dropdown menu and save your changes using the save button. This is where one can also customize the three colors used for highlighting.</p>\n" +

            "                    <p>Hyperspektrale Bilder verfügen über mehr Spektrentreue und Präzision zur Profilierung von Organismen im Gegensatz zu normalen RGB-Bildern, sodass ich diese für die Untersuchung gewählt habe. Diese Eigenschaften führen aber auch zu einer Vielzahl von Dimensionen, die es zu reduzieren gilt. Es liegt nahe, Dimensionsreduktionstechniken anzuwenden, um sich des Problems der zu vielen Dimensionen anzunehmen. Einerseits kann ich mich dazu entscheiden, Bildkanäle von den üblicherweise mehreren hunderten je nach Relevanz mittels Feature Extraction zusammenzufassen oder irrelevante gleich zu entfernen (Feature Selection). Auf der anderen Seite untersuche ich, wie sinnvoll es ist, das Modell zu komprimieren, indem ich Verbindungen zwischen Neuronen, die am wenigsten zum Endergebnis beitragen, entferne (Parameter Pruning) oder die Gewichte dieser Verbindungen mittels eines Codebooks mit weniger Bits repräsentiere (z.B. Post-Training Vector Quantization). Diese Analyse dient dazu, die Auswirkungen von Kompression auf verschiedenen Ebenen zu prüfen, indem ich die Tradeoffs bzgl. Parameter wie Speicherverbrauch, Berechnungsaufwand und Genauigkeit analysiere und durch Visualisierung der Layer des neuronalen Netzes nachvollziehen will, welche Bildteile besonders relevant für die Aktivierung ausschlaggebender Neuronen sind.</p>\n" +

            "                    <p>Es hat sich herauskristallisiert, dass ein in Maßen angewendetes Parameter Pruning (je nach Modell z.B. 40%) nicht nur keine Erkennungsgenauigkeit verschlechtert, sondern sie im Vergleich zum Referenzmodell sogar erhöht, während Modellgröße, VRAM- und RAM-Verbrauch abnehmen. Erst bei höheren Prozentzahlen als 40-50% leidet die Genauigkeit, zum Ende hin deutlich zunehmend (80-90%). Die Parameteranzahl linearer Layer lässt sich ohne Genauigkeitsverlust in größerem Umfang reduzieren als bei convolutional Layern. Besonders bei großen CNN-Modellen sind erhebliche Größeneinsparungen möglich. Feature Extraction-Verfahren wie PCA, NMF und LLE benötigen nur wenige Bildbänder als Komponenten zum schnellen Erreichen einer zufriedenstellenden Genauigkeit, während sich Feature Selection wesentlich unberechenbarer verhält. Eine komponentenweise Variation mit Post-Training Quantization stellt die Akkumulatoren als wichtigste Komponenten heraus, gefolgt von Aktivierungen und Gewichten des CNNs, jedoch ohne Genauigkeitsgewinn. Die genannten Kompressionen lassen sich akkumulieren, was zu vergleichsweise hohen Genauigkeiten bei noch weniger Komplexität führt. Visualisierungen zeigen, dass erst bei hohen Kompressionszahlen bedeutende Gradienten des CNNs sich merklich verändern und mit ihnen die Genauigkeit. Trotz der zufriedenstellenden Ergebnisse stellt die derzeit mangelhafte Toolunterstützung, insbesondere für den hyperspektralen Fall, das wohl bedeutendste Hindernis für die Nutzung von Pruning und Quantization im industriellen Maßstab dar.</p>\n" +

Jednak duży rozmiar modelu utrudnia ich wdrożenie na urządzeniach mobilnych. Dlatego postanowiłem zbadać kompresję sieci neuronowych bez powodowania znacznej utraty dokładności w mojej pracy magisterskiej. Ponadto wykonuję kompresję obrazu jako sposób na zmniejszenie złożoności obliczeniowej i połączenie obu typów kompresji.</p>\n" +
            "                    <p>Obrazy hiperspektralne mają większą wierność spektralną i precyzję do profilowania organizmów niż obrazy RGB, dlatego wybrałem je do projektu. Niemniej jednak właściwości te prowadzą do dużej liczby wymiarów, które należy zmniejszyć, np. za pomocą technik zmniejszania wymiarów. Z jednej strony można zdecydować o zmniejszeniu liczby zwykle setek kanałów obrazu zgodnie z ich stosownością za pomocą funkcji dla ekstrakcji (feature extraction) lub usunięcia nieistotnych kanałów (feature selection). Z drugiej strony badam przydatność kompresji modelu, usuwając połączenia między neuronami, które w najmniejszym stopniu przyczyniają się do wyniku końcowego (parameter pruning), i używam książki kodów do reprezentowania wag tych połączeń przy użyciu mniejszej liczby bitów (np. post-training vector quantization). Celem tej procedury jest zbadanie skutków kompresji na wielu poziomach poprzez analizę kompromisów dotyczących parametrów takich jak użycie pamięci, koszt obliczeniowy i precyzja oraz wizualizacja warstw sieci neuronowej w celu zrozumienia, które części obrazu są najbardziej istotne dla aktywacji decydujących neuronów.</p>\n" +

            "                    <p>Okazało się, że umiarkowane przycinanie parametrów (w zależności od modelu, nawet do 40 procent) nie tylko nie zmniejsza dokładności klasyfikacji, ale nawet poprawia ją w porównaniu do odniesienia, podczas gdy rozmiar modelu, użycie pamięci VRAM i pamięci RAM spada. Tylko przy wartościach procentowych większych niż 40 do 50 procent dokładność pogarsza się, co pogarsza się coraz bardziej pod koniec (pruning od 80 do 90 procent). Liczbę parametrów w warstwach liniowych można zmniejszyć bardziej niż w przypadku warstw splotowych bez utraty dokładności. W szczególności, duże modele CNN oferują znaczny potencjał zmniejszenia rozmiaru modelu. Techniki ekstrakcji cech (feature extraction), takie jak PCA, NMF i LLE, wymagają tylko kilku pasm obrazu jako składników, aby szybko osiągnąć wysoką dokładność, a wybór funkcji (feature selection) działa znacznie mniej przewidywalnie. Wariacja składowa z kwantyzacją po treningu ujawnia, że akumulatory są najważniejszymi składnikami, po których następują odpowiednio aktywacje i wagi CNN, ale bez zwiększenia dokładności. Podane kompresje mogą być kumulowane, co prowadzi do porównywalnie wysokich dokładności bez tak dużej złożoności. Wizualizacje pokazują, że tylko przy wysokich współczynnikach kompresji znaczące gradienty CNN zmieniają się znacząco, a wraz z nimi dokładność. Pomimo satysfakcjonujących wyników, obecnie słabe wsparcie narzędziowe, szczególnie w przypadku hiperspektralnym, jest prawdopodobnie najważniejszą przeszkodą w stosowaniu pruningu i kwantyzacji na skalę przemysłową.</p>\n" +

Po wybraniu pytania kandydat może przesłać odpowiedź za pomocą dowolnego tekstu, głosu lub wideo. AI platformy Azure ocenia poprawność odpowiedzi za pomocą słów kluczowych, które z niej wyodrębnia.

Oczywiście klikanie pól staje się bardzo nudne. Ponadto postęp w grze jest bardzo wolny. Istnieje jednak waluta premium o nazwie monety. Moneta jest warta dziesiątki tysięcy root talarów (waluta w grze) na rynku w grze. Można zdobyć te monety patrząc na reklamę, ale według mojej analizy ten system reklamowy jest technicznie wadliwy, tak że wdrożony przez mnie dowód koncepcji może potencjalnie wygenerować nieskończoną liczbę monet, rzekomo patrząc na reklamę.</p>" +

Upraszcza to sadzenie i podlewanie warzyw i stanowi dobrą podstawę do planowania makr za pomocą crona lub narzędzia do planowania zadań systemu Windows.

Zasadniczo trzeba wygenerować tokena i użyć go jako parametr oddzwaniania, jak pokazuje mój film na YouTube. Aby uprościć pracę, napisałem program Java, za pomocą którego można zautomatyzować odtwarzanie żądań. Za pomocą tego narzędzia Java można także wyświetlać reklamy z kina samochodowego (wydarzenie w grze), wymieniać monety i ukończyć niekończącą się serię zadań. Są to misje, które można wykonać tylko w określonym miejscu, do którego można przejść w środy i soboty w grze, ale dzięki niepoprawnemu programowaniu mogę ominąć to ograniczenie lokalizacji i wykonać zadanie co 24 godziny.</p>"+
